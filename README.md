# Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024 — EDA

**One-liner:** Exploratory Data Analysis of the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2024.

## Context
This project was developed as part of the **Data Science Bootcamp at CodeOp**.  

Spotify is one of the world’s largest audio streaming platforms with over 675 million monthly active users (263 million subscribers).  
The dataset compiles the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2024, including track attributes, popularity, and presence on other platforms (YouTube, TikTok, etc.).  
It contains track name, artist, release date, ISRC, streaming statistics, and engagement metrics.

## Goals of the EDA
1. **Analyze Popularity Trends** – relationship between Spotify streams and popularity.  
2. **Correlation Analysis** – explore how popularity correlates with numerical metrics (streams, playlist reach, engagement).  
3. **Artist Popularity Analysis** – identify top artists and distribution of their tracks’ popularity.  
4. **Platform Comparison** – compare Spotify with Pandora, Soundcloud, YouTube, TikTok.  
5. **Trend Analysis by Release Date** – how release year relates to popularity.  
6. **Explicit vs Non-Explicit Songs** – differences in popularity and engagement.  
7. **Track Score vs Popularity** – correlation between internal “track score” and Spotify popularity.
